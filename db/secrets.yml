# Here I should write the mapping between covers and secrets.
# Below are listed all the elements that can be encoded withing a java class

# - modifiers (public, private)
# - return types (void, String, Custom, ...)
# - method names
# - arguments (number, order, names, types)

# What about class fields ?

PAD_FILLING: '0'
STEP: 6
modifiers:
  - public: 1
  - private: 2
  - protected: 3
  - static: 4
# Having coherent method names with coherent arguments makes the cover more realistic
covers:
  - method1:
      methodName: 'soyElMetodo1'
      method args: [s]
